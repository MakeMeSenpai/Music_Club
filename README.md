# Make School Music Club

**SPD UI/UX project**
I felt no pride in making just another website. So I decided that I would make some use out of
what I was workng on. The plan is simple. Build a website that meets all the rubrics goals.
Sounds boring right? Well the second part of this plan is to actually attriibute my work onto 
my schools website, as to help grow our community, and help our clubs out. This will be based
off of my own club, and I hope it will help bring attention and support to mine, and our other
student ran clubs who have been having a hard time all year to really keep things going.
