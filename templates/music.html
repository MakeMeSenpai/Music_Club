    <h2 id="about">About Us</h2>
        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>We are Programmers, Entrepreneurs, and Artists. We are hard workers who couldn't for the
            life of us let music go. Some of us have never touched an instrument before in our lives.
            While others wonder how we can even find the time. We are performers, teachers, and
            learners. We are a group of procrastinators, and a group of good friends. But overall,
            We are the Music club, and we aren't afraid of no carpal tunnel! If this sounds like you,
            than come <a href="#join">join</a> us (every Music Mondays from 5:30-7pm)!</p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>There were always music lovers who came to Make School -and even Make Games. However, Make
            School lacked any real clubs, and for students trying to run their own clubs, it quickly
            fell apart as the year became more and more busy. The only ones to survive this chaos was
            the D&D Club at the time. There was a Music Club before us, however, the Music Club that
            existed before us was a choir group, who sung songs, but rarely met. They separated after
            the second month of school, and became smaller groups or individuals who performed on their
            own. Then, in 2019, Anthony S. Protho founded the newest Music Club, and was dedicated to
            making a place for music lovers to destress, learn, and jam out with friends. With the help
            of its most dedicated members, (including Luke Harrison, Beck Haywood, Ike Holzmann, Cao
            Mai, and Chris Barnes) they were able to get to work to make this become a reality. After
            quickly setting up a Bake Sale for school instruments, all was thought to have failed. We
            believed at the time that maybe this would never really happen. Until help came, from some
            amazing staff members (including Megan Dias, Ellie MacBride, Precious Listana), who helped
            us get our feet on the ground. Now the Music Club, with its new home in the Schools
            Basement -originally in the Great Hall- is growing and performing at Make School events. <i>

            never been the way I had dreamed. Thank you all"</i> ~Ant üêú

        such as reeds or strings.
